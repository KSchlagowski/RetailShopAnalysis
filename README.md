# RetailShopAnalysis
In this project we will analyse retail shop dataset using PostgreSQL.

We will try to find an answer to some questions:
- What is the distribution of prices across dataset?
- What is the distribution of order values across all customers in the dataset?
- Which countries are our most significant customers?
- How many unique products has each customer purchased?
- Which customers have only made a single purchase from the company?
- Which products are most commonly purchased together by customers in the dataset?
- What product do customers buy most often?
- What product do customers without account buy most often?
- How many products were purchased in total? How much on average per customer?
- How many returns were there in total? How much on average per customer?
